<!-- THE DATASET -->
## <br>**➲ The Dataset**
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/bike-buyers" target="_blank">The Bike Buyers Dataset</a>  encompasses a rich set of features, offering valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences related to bike purchases.<br>
**Features:** 
- ID: Unique identifier for each record.  
- Marital Status: Relationship status of the buyer ('Single' or 'Married').    
- Gender: Gender of the buyer ('Male' or 'Female').   
- Income: Financial income of the buyer.  
- Children: Number of children in the buyer's household.

- Home Owner: Ownership status of the buyer's residence.  
- Cars: Number of cars owned by the buyer.  
- Commute Distance: Distance of the buyer's commute.  
- Region: Geographic region of the buyer.  
- Age: Age of the buyer.  
- Purchased Bike: Binary indicator of bike purchase ('Yes' or 'No').

<!-- DATA CLEANING -->
## <br>**➲ Data Cleaning**
The dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning through the following procedures:
* Reformulation of the Marital Status column: Substituting 'S' with 'Single' and 'M' with 'Married'.
* Refinement of the Gender column: Transformation of 'F' to 'Female' and 'M' to 'Male'.
* Introduction of the 'Age Brackets' column via a nested IF formula based on age conditions.

<!-- DATA ANALYSIS -->
## <br>**➲ Data Analysis**
In this part we create 3 pivot tables to get useful insights and then use these tables to create a dynamic dashboard where we analyze the following :  
* Average Income Per Purchase
Table 1 demonstrates the average income per gender juxtaposed with the number of purchases.
